Hi, I am Nathan! I am currently a Senior Threat Researcher from Trend Micro. My work focused on hunting new and notable threats, analyzing malware, investigating campaigns and tracking ransomware groups. I also publish threat intelligence blogs to share my research findings and have some experience speaking at cybersecurity conferences where I presented my research and connected with the cybersecurity community.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling to new places, practicing Judo and also playing video games during my free time to help me recharge :grin:
